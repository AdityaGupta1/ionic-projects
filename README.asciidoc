= ionic-projects

== Overview

This repository is for all my projects using the Ionic framework. The main app right now is '`election2016`', but there are other ones as well.

== What I learned

* Some CSS attributes (like `position` and `float`)
* Some fundamental JavaScript concepts (`function`, `var`, etc.)
* `$http.get()`
* Asynchronous processes in JavaScript
* Database creation and manipulation with Firebase and AngularFire
* Three main parts of an application (UI, services, data)
