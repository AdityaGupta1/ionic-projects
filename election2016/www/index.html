        <b>Election year.</b> Time to vote for the next leader of the United States of America. A leader who must be trustworthy, diplomatic, intelligent, and experienced. But there's a problem. None of the candidates this year have those qualities. Here's a quick overview of how they fare (in my opinion):
      </p>
      <center><table style="width:65%">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Candidate</b></td>
          <td><b>Trustworthy</b></td>
          <td><b>Diplomatic</b></td>
          <td><b>Intelligent</b></td>
          <td><b>Experienced</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Donald Trump</td>
          <td>Probably not</td> 
          <td>No</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hillary Clinton</td>
          <td>No</td> 
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Maybe</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
      </table></center>
      <br>
      <p>
        This doesn't bode well for America. A leader who isn't trustworthy won't follow through on promises. A leader who isn't diplomatic won't be able to keep up foreign relations. A leader who isn't intelligent won't be able to lead the country in the right socioeconomic direction. A leader who isn't experienced won't know how to deal with the higher responsibility required.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, American law says we have to elect a new president - Current President Barack Obama has already served his maximum of two terms. These are the only candidates we have, and we have to pick from them. I only hope that America manages to choose the best choice.
      </p>

        This app provides information about both of the candidates so that you can make the right choice. Choose one of the following candidates to learn about:
